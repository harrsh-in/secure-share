# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **1. Product Overview**

### **Vision Statement**

Build a truly ephemeral, anonymous peer-to-peer file transfer platform where users can share unlimited files through shareable links and QR codes, with zero server storage and zero data persistence.

### **Product Goals**

- **Truly Ephemeral**: Files and sessions exist only while sender's browser tab is open
- **Zero Storage**: No files, user metadata, or session data stored anywhere
- **Unlimited Sharing**: No restrictions on file size, type, or quantity
- **Simple UX**: Upload files → Generate link → Share anywhere
- **Multi-User Support**: Multiple recipients can download simultaneously
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a modern browser

### **Target Users**

- **Primary**: Privacy-conscious individuals requiring truly anonymous file sharing
- **Secondary**: Developers, journalists, and professionals needing temporary file transfers
- **Tertiary**: General users seeking simple, no-registration, no-trace file sharing

## **2. User Stories**

### **Core User Journey**

```
As a sender, I want to:
- Upload unlimited files (any type, any size)
- Generate a shareable link and QR code instantly
- Share this link/QR code via any platform
- See real-time transfer progress for all recipients
- Know that everything disappears when I close my browser tab

As a recipient, I want to:
- Click a shared link or scan a QR code
- See available files and their sizes
- Download all files at once or selectively
- Experience fast, direct downloads
- Download files even while others are downloading simultaneously
```

### **Enhanced User Stories**

- **Batch Operations**: "As a sender, I want to create multiple transfer sessions simultaneously"
- **Multi-User Downloads**: "As a platform, I want to support multiple users downloading from the same sender concurrently"
- **Device Agnostic**: "As a user, I want to use QR codes on any device, not just mobile"
- **Session Awareness**: "As a sender, I want to know when my session will end (tab close = session end)"

## **3. Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 File Upload & Management**

- **Unlimited File Selection**: Support drag-and-drop and file browser selection
- **No File Type Restrictions**: Accept all file types without limitations
- **No File Size Limits**: Individual files and total transfer size unlimited

### **3.2 Link Generation & Sharing**

- **Instant Link Generation**: Create unique URLs immediately upon file selection
- **QR Code Generation**: Generate QR codes for any device (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- **Universal Sharing**: Copy link, download QR code, direct platform sharing
- **Session-Based Existence**: Links exist only while sender's browser tab is open
- **No Expiration Settings**: Links die when browser tab closes, period

### **3.3 Transfer Management**

- **Real-time Status**: Live connection status and transfer progress
- **Multi-Recipient Support**: Unlimited recipients per shared link
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Multiple recipients downloading simultaneously
- **Batch Downloads**: Each recipient can download multiple files concurrently

- **Session Termination**: Immediate session end when sender closes browser tab

### **3.4 Security & Privacy**

- **End-to-End Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all file transfers
- **No Server Storage**: Files never touch any server storage
- **Zero Metadata**: No session data, logs, or metadata stored anywhere
- **Anonymous Usage**: No user tracking, registration, or identification
- **Ephemeral Nature**: Complete data destruction on session end

## **4. Technical Requirements**

### **4.1 Core Architecture**

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Minimal Express.js signaling server (WebRTC coordination only)
- **P2P Layer**: WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer connections
- **File Handling**: Stream-based chunking for unlimited file sizes
- **Session Management**: Browser-based session management (no server state)

### **4.2 Zero-Storage Design**

- **No Database**: No Redis, no SQL, no file storage
- **Memory-Only**: All session data in browser memory
- **Stateless Server**: Signaling server holds no state between requests
- **Immediate Cleanup**: Automatic memory cleanup on session end

### **4.3 Scalability Requirements**

- **Signaling Only**: Server only facilitates WebRTC handshakes
- **P2P Bandwidth**: All file transfer bandwidth is peer-to-peer
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale signaling servers independently
- **Resource Efficient**: Minimal server resources required

## **5. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **5.1 Performance**

- **Connection Time**: <5 seconds for P2P connection establishment
- **Transfer Speed**: Full bandwidth utilization (no artificial limits)
- **UI Responsiveness**: <100ms response time for all interactions
- **Unlimited Throughput**: No artificial bandwidth restrictions

### **5.2 Reliability**

- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability for signaling infrastructure
- **Transfer Resilience**: Graceful handling of connection interruptions
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed chunks
- **Cross-browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Fallback Strategy**: Recipients can refresh link to restart downloads

### **5.3 Security**

- **Zero Data Exposure**: No data ever touches server storage
- **Encryption By Default**: All transfers encrypted automatically
- **Anonymous Operation**: No user identification or tracking
- **Immediate Destruction**: Complete data destruction on tab close

## **6. Success Metrics**

### **6.2 Technical Performance**

- **Connection Success Rate**: >95% P2P connections established
- **Transfer Speed**: Achieve 80% of theoretical maximum bandwidth
- **Error Rate**: <2% failed transfers due to technical issues
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal server CPU/memory usage
